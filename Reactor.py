Reactor (Checks for a combination of conditions across sensors and triggers a response) [Alex]
  - Subscribes to a number of sensors
  - Triggers a reaction event that comprises a vector addition in EmotionalModule. This means it must be aware of the dimensions of the EmotionalModule.
  - [Optional] May trigger an Action directly (this is the idea of "reflexive actions" not governed by the AI)
  - e.g. LonelinessReactor, CrowdReactor, StaringReactor, ChildReactor
