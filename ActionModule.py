"""
* ActionModule (does things) [Alex/Marco/Mauro]
  - Maintains a list of Actions that can be performed
  - Handles conflicting concurrent gestures (note: we need to talk about how to resolve this)
  - Handles gestures that would take the system out of range (such as chaining gestures in one direction, providing illegal parameters, etc)
  - Handles eye stabilisation
  - Handles zero-finding during startup (in case of unexpected shutdown)
